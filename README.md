The Runic Isles: Metroidvania Month 28 Jam What's This?

We're designing The Runic Isles for the Metroidvania Month 28 Game Jam, running May 15, 2025 to June 15, 2025. All assets, work, etc. will need to be completed/created during the timeframe of the Game Jam.
The Aesthetics

A pixel-art 2D platformer with a Castlevania flavor.
The Mechanics

We will have Combat (melee and spells), Crafting. Environmental Puzzles, and Platformer-like movement to begin.
The Story

In a world where magic is channeled through Runes rather than innately powered, play as a Rune-Mage going through their Rites of Passage in the The Runic Isles. Use legendary runes in Runecrafting to create Runespells to aid in your adventure through the Isles ranging from combat to environmental puzzles to so much more.

Engine: Godot
